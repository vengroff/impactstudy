    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = f'(X') + Z\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $f'$ is some unknown function and $Z$ is some random noise.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The domain of $f'$ is $X'$, a vector of $m' = m + s$ features that\n",
    "is further broken down into $m$ features $X = (x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_{m-1})$\n",
    "and $s$ confounding features $C = (c_0, c_1, \\ldots, c_{s-1})$. The difference\n",
    "between $X$ and $C$ is that the features $x_i \\in X$ have some impact on the\n",
    "value of $f'$ while the features in $c_i \\in C$ have no effect. Essentially,\n",
    "the $c_i$ are just there to confuse or confound us. We don't know which\n",
    "of the features we observe in $X'$ are the $x_i$ and which are the $c_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "More formally, the function $f'$ can be written as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f'(X') = f(X)\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Set up the experiment:\n",
    "    1. Define the signal function $f(X)$;\n",
    "    1. Decided how $X$ and $C$ will be jointly distributed;\n",
    "    1. Define a model for the noise $Z$.\n",
    "1. Run the experiment:\n",
    "    1. Generate $n$ samples of $X'$ according to some joint distribution;\n",
    "    1. Generate impact charts for the impact of each feature or confounding feature in $X'$ on $y$.\n",
    "1. Evaluate the impacts $I$ found as compared to the true impacts encoded in the definition of $f'$.\n",
    "    1. What is the mean squared error between the modeled impact and the true impacts.\n",
    "    2. Are there non-zero impacts $I(c_i)$ and are they expected?"
